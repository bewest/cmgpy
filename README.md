Unapy - universal network adapter in python
============================================

I'm interested in making a python interface for modems. 
Handle SMS, etc.


The following commands are implemented

at
at+cfun
at+cmgf
at+csca
at+cmgr
at+cmgl

I wouldn't be surprised if they don't work 100\%. 
More will be implemented as I need them. 

Implementation is not really that difficult. 
Mostly following the alredy implemented commands would be sufficient.
