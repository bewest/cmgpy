PROTECTION

The new GE865 product family introduces the smallest GSM/GPRS Ball-Grid-Array (BGA)
modules in the market.

BUSINESS
SCALABLE

The low profile and small size of the unique BGA package for the GE865-QUAD enable the
design of extremely compact applications. Since connectors are eliminated, the solution
cost is significantly reduced compared to conventional mounting.

With its ultra-compact design and extended temperature range, the Telit GE865 product
line is the perfect platform for high-volume m2m applications and mobile data devices.
Additional features such as integrated TCP/IP protocol stack and serial multiplexer extend
functionality of the application at no additional cost.
The GE865 makes it possible to run the customer's application inside the module using
Python Script Interpreter, thus making it the smallest, complete platform for m2m
solutions.
All Telit modules, support Over-the-Air firmware update by means Premium FOTA
Management. By embedding RedBend’s vCurrent® agent, a proven and battle-tested
technology powering hundreds of millions of cellular handsets world-wide Telit is able
to update its products by transmitting only a delta file, which represents the difference
between one firmware version and another.
As a part of Telit’s corporate policy of environmental protection, all products comply to the
RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) directive of the European Union (EU Directive
2002/95/EG).
