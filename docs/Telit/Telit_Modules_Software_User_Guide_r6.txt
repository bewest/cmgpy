2.4.

First Telit Module Approach
After a proper Power ON sequence the Telit module is ready to receive AT commands
on its Serial Port. Some functions have to be checked in order to be sure that the
module is ready to send and receive calls and SMS.

2.4.1.

Telit Module Identification
Use the following AT command to verify if the connection between DTE and Telit
module (DCE) is working. The current serial port speed setting is Autobauding (Factory
Setting):
AT
OK
Use the following AT commands to verify the Software version and Telit module
identification:


AT+CGMR: Returns the Software version information



AT+CGMM: Returns the Telit Module identification

Examples
Checking the software version
AT+CGMR
10.00.004
OK
Checking the module identification
AT+CGMM
GM862-QUAD
OK

2.4.2.

Band Configuration
Use the following AT command to select the current band range:
AT#BND=[<band>];
The range of parameter <band> depends on the SELINT configuration, see [1] for
details.
Examples
AT#BND=[0]
Selected band: GSM 900MHz + DCS 1800MHz.

Telit GSM/GPRS Family Software User Guide
1vv0300784 rev.6 2010-10-04
Use the following AT command to enable/disable the automatic band selection at
power-on.:
AT#AUTOBND=[<value>];

The range of parameter <value> depends on the SELINT configuration, see [1] for
details.
The module is a quad band device, but in any case it is necessary to set the correct
working bands, see [1] for details.

2.4.3.

Enabling the Extended Error Result codes
To enable the error report in numerical format for +Cxxx commands, issue the
following command:
AT+CMEE=1
OK
To enable the error report in verbose format for +Cxxx commands, issue the following
command:
AT+CMEE=2
OK

2.4.4.

Second Interface Instance
Use the following AT command to activate one of the three AT instances available and
assign it to the ASC1 serial port, see fig. 1.
AT#SII = <inst>
For parameter description, refer to [1].
Examples
AT#SII?
#SII: 0

Trace service is connected to ASC1, see fig. 1

OK
AT#SII=1

ASC1 is disconnected from Trace service
and connected to AT1 Parser.
ASC0 is still connected to AT0 Parser.

A wrong parameter is entered just to see the result format when verbose extended
error result is enabled:
AT+CSQ?
+CME ERROR: operation not supported
NOTE:
When Received Signal Strength Indication is less than 6 the radio link quality is poor,
the call could be cut off.
NOTE:
The quality is measured on the traffic channel, hence it is available only during a
conversation, in Idle the reported value must not be considered.

In conversation the quality decreases with the increase of the <ber> number.

NOTE:
The <ber> value refers strictly to the GSM radio channel and is a very technical
parameter; it can be used to monitor the voice call quality since the voice quality is
inversely proportional to the <ber> number.
NOTE:
The reported signal quality only refers to the GSM radio channel link and not to the
whole path from the caller to the receiver. It may happen that the quality on the GSM
radio link is very good and hence the reported <ber> is 0 (good quality) but the quality of
the remaining path to the other party is very bad and hence the final data connection
quality is very poor. For this reason the signal quality indicator <ber> should not be
taken into account to monitor data calls quality.

2.4.8.4.

Network Status Checking
Once the Telit Module is registered on a Network, it could be useful to know the
received signal strength and the Network on which the Telit Module is registered. This
information can be gathered by means of the following standard AT commands: +CREG,
+COPS and +CSQ. These commands are not fast in the response due to Network

NOTE:
This command should be used only to gather information about network name and
signal strength. To check if mobile is registered or is looking for a suitable network to
register on, use +CREG command. As a matter of fact, if the network signal is too weak
and mobile looses the registration, until a new network is found the #MONI command
reports the last measured valid values and not the real ones. The TA (timing advance
parameter) is valid only during a call.
TIP:
Check network registration with +CREG command. When mobile is registered, query
the mobile for network operator name and signal strength with #MONI command.

2.8.

Enabling TTY Function
The characters entered through the TTY device, connected to the Telit module (see fig.
2), are coded using the following two tones: 1400 Hz and 1800 Hz. These tones are not
supported by the GSM speech coder, consequently they must be transformed to be
compatible with the speech coder. This activity is performed by the CTM modem that in
the Telit module solution is internal to the module itself. The internal CTM modem
transforms the two unsupported tones into the following four tones: 400Hz, 600Hz,
800Hz, 1000Hz that can be managed by the speech coder. The TTY device can be
connected to the Telit module using one of the two audio paths provided by the module
itself. This feature enables the transmission of the TTY data and voice jointly on the
existing speech channel of the module.

2.9.1.

RTS detection of DTE
RTS of DTE is checked by the module every GSM TDMA frame (4.61 ms). As soon as RTS
of DTE is detected as NOT asserted the module immediately stops the transmitting of
bytes toward DTE equipment.
Consequently, the maximum number of characters that Telit module can send to the
DTE when RTS of DTE is NOT asserted depends on the used baud rate.
Example:


at 115200 8N1 the maximum number of characters (bytes) is 54
115200 8N1 => 115200 bit/s = 11520 char/s = 11.52 char/ms = 53.1 char/frame




2.9.2.

at 57600 8N1 the maximum number of characters (bytes) is 27
at 9600 8N1 is 5

CTS assertion of Module
CTS is asserted by the module when the data in its receiver buffer is grater than 75%
(0x1000 bytes), the DTE transmission is stopped. CTS is NOT asserted when data in the
receiver buffer of the module is lower than 25%, the DTE transmission starts again.

Call Barring Control
The Call Barring service enables the User to control the calls. The User can block all
outgoing calls, or all outgoing international calls, or all outgoing international calls
except those for its Country, or all incoming calls, or all incoming calls while roaming.
User can activate or cancel Call Barring using the right AT commands hereafter
described. Moreover, the User needs to enter a special access code (Call Barring
Access Code) to modify Call Barring options. The Call Barring Code is provided by
Network Operator for every subscriber. Hereafter the Call Barring Code is indicated as
“network password provided by Network Operator”.
For the entire Call Barring service list and related AT commands refer to [1].

NOTE:
The Call Barring service is handled by the network, hence all the relative AT commands
issue a network request and it may take several seconds to have the response from the
network.
Furthermore, all the Call Barring service AT commands must be issued when the
mobile is Registered on some Network, otherwise an error code is returned.

Storing MSISDN into SIM
MSISDN is a number used to identify a mobile phone number internationally. MSISDN
is defined by the Recommendation [12] which defines the numbering plan: a number
uniquely identifies a public network termination point and typically consists of three
fields, CC (country code), NDC (national destination code), and SN (subscriber number),
up to 15 digits in total.
Use the following AT command to store the MSISDN on the assigned field (EF_MSISDN)
of the SIM card. The User needs to follow the hereafter procedure which involves the
structure knowledge of the field used by the SIM card to storage the MSISDN number.
AT+CRSM=<command>[,<file id>[,<P1>,<P2>,<P3>[,<data>]]]

DTMF Tones
There are telephone systems which can be controlled by DTMF tones. To use these
devices it is needed to have a phone that can send DTMF tones. When a key on the
phone is pressed during a phone call this character is sent using DTMF. The following
characters can be sent using DTMF: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,* and #. The DTMF
keypad is laid out in a 4×4 matrix, with each row representing a low frequency, and
each column representing a high frequency (see Tab. 3). Pressing a single key such as
'1' will send a sinusoidal tone of the two frequencies 697 Hz and 1209 Hz.

GSM Power Saving Function
The Telit module is provided with a function that reduces the power consumption
5
during the period when it is in IDLE state, allowing a longer activity with a given battery
capacity. Tab. 4 and Tab. 5 summarize the performances of the various +CFUN
commands.
To introduce the matter, let’s suppose to enter the command AT+CFUN=5. This
command monitors the DTR line, see fig. 5, indicating if the User Application is ready to
operate:


when the DTR line is OFF (high, 3V on UART), the User Application is not ready
to operate and the module can save energy by shutting down its serial port;



when the User Application becomes ready to operate again the DTR line is ON
(low, 0V on UART), the module detects this control line condition and powers up
the serial port.

The DTR serial control line is used in CFUN=5 and in CFUN=7 mode, see fig. 5.

Another example: let’s suppose to enter the command AT+CFUN=0 or AT+CFUN=9.
This command forces immediately the module in power saving mode, moreover it
forces the module to monitor the RTS line indicating if the User Application is ready to
send commands on the serial port. In this mode the module can detected also other
events; see Tab. 4 and Tab. 5:




5

RTS line ON (low, 0V on UART, default state) causes the module (DCE, see fig.
4 ) to assume the data channel transmit mode; the User Application is not going
to send any AT commands. The module, accordingly with its transmitting needs,
can save energy by shutting down its serial port;
when the User Application needs to send data to the module the RTS line is OFF
(high, 3V on UART). This condition causes the module (DCE) to assume the data
channel non-transmit mode, powers up the serial port and enters CFUN=1
mode (Normal Operative Mode).

The module in IDLE state is waiting for a call.

Telit GSM/GPRS Family Software User Guide
1vv0300784 rev.6 2010-10-04

NOTE:
The power saving function does not affect the network activity of the module: during the
power saving mode the module remains registered on the network and reachable for
incoming calls or SMS. If a call comes in during the power saving mode, the module
will wake up and proceed normally with the unsolicited incoming call code.
TIP:
When the module is in sleep mode, the paging time is in the interval 0.5 ÷ 2.1 sec (It
depends by DRX time set by network). When the module wakes up from the sleep mode,
it takes a maximum of 150 ms before checking the DTR line coming from the User
Application. So if a command is received during the sleep interval, the module needs at
least (0.5÷2.1)s+150 ms to be ready. Hence use a delay of at least 2250 ms between the
port opening (DTR=ON) and command sending.
RTS=OFF and DTR=ON events both force the module to exit the power saving mode.
According to the V.24 standard: when the module is not ready to receive commands it
will tie up the CTS line (refer to fig. 5), when it is ready to receive commands it will tie
down the CTS line; hence the User Application can monitor the CTS line to check if the
module is ready for commands.

NOTE: fun = 1, module with full functionality and Power Saving disabled (Factory default)

TIPS:
When the module is powered ON the power saving function is disabled (factory setting) in
order to guarantee the AT command exchange with the module even if the DTR line is not
supported; for this reason the power saving setting command should be issued after every
power up.
The protocol implementation of the Module requires a delay between the consecutive
activation of CFUN=1 and CFUN=4 (or vice versa) commands. It is suggested to use a delay of
10 sec.

Checking SMS Service Centre Number
An SMS is sent by the Telit module to a Service Centre (SMSC) where the message is
dispatched towards its final destination or is kept until the delivery is possible. To
ensure the correct operation of this service the number of the SMS Service Centre
needs to be configured on the module in accordance with the Network Operator used.
To know the SMSC number stored on the module, use the following AT command.
AT+CSCA?
Responses:


+CSCA: ……… (Refer to [1] for the details.)
OK



ERROR



Selecting SMS Memory and Checking for Memory Space
Telit Modules provide two types of SMS storage:


"ME" - mobile equipment memory



"SM" - SIM Card memory

An SMS (sent and received) is usually stored in the “SM” storage. The "ME" storage is a
read only memory, where the received messages of Class 0 are stored regardless of

Cell Broadcast Service
GSM standard specifies two different types of SMS: SMS Point to Point (SMS/PP) and
the SMS Cell Broadcast (SMS/CB). The first type can send a text message long up to
160 characters from a module to the another (as stated on the previous paragraphs),
the second type allows the Network to send, at the same time, a message to all
modules contained in the defined area including one or more radio cells. The
availability and the implementation of the Cell Broadcast Service are strictly connected
with the Network Operator of the subscriber.
Use the following AT command to enable the Cell Broadcast Service:
AT+CSCB=[<mode>[,<mids>[,<dcss>]]]
For parameter details refer to [1].
Responses:


General Purpose Input/Output Pins
Telit Modules are provided with various General Purpose Input/Output pins, which can
be configured by means of AT commands as Inputs, Outputs and some of them as
"Alternate Functions". For a detailed Input/Output pins description from the circuitry
point of view refer to [3] in accordance with used Telit Module.
User Applications by means of the GPIO AT commands can control external User
equipments connected to Telit Module pins. Few or no circuitries are needed to
perform the required hardware interface.
Before using the GPIO pins, the User must configure them to select their direction or
“Alternate Function”. Tab. 6 shows the Telit modules and their GPIO pins.

3.9.5.

Clock and Alarm Functions
Telit Modules are provided with Real Time Clock and Alarm features which implement
the following functions:


Setting up the right time



Checking the actual time



Setting up an alarm time

Use +CALA AT command to perform the alarm setting. To avoid losing the time setting
there must not be any interruption of the power supply of the Telit Module. In general,
update the Telit Module clock before using the Alarm feature.
On alarm trigger the Telit Module can do the following:


Automatically Wake-up fully operative from shutdown



Automatically Wake-up in the dedicated "Alarm Status" from shutdown. The
module does not look for or try to register on any network, it performs only the
previously programmed “alarm actions” and it can receive AT commands to
become fully operative or shut down immediately.



If already ON at alarm trigger time, it simply performs the “alarm actions”

Once woken up, the Telit Module performs the chosen action that can be the following:


Issue an Unsolicited Code "+CALA: <user_text>" on the serial port until a 90s
timeout expires or a special Wake-up command is received.



Play an Alarm tone until a 90s timeout expires or a special Wake-up command
is received.



Rise the pin GPIO6 until a 90s timeout expires or a special Wake-up command is
received.



Any combination of the above actions.

Example actions the Telit Module can perform using these features:


Wake up itself and its controlling hardware, by means of the GPIO6 pin, at the
desired time: a timely survey can be programmed without the need to power on
any hardware; the objective to minimize power consumption is reached.



Activate some User devices on a time trigger event by means of the GPIO6 pin.



Alert the User Application that the “alarm time” is expired by means of the
previously programmed Unsolicited Code "+CALA:<user_text>".



Alert the User playing the alarm tone.

can do the following:


Decide to exit from “Alarm Activity” and shut down the module



Exit from “Alarm Activity” and enter the “Normal Operational Status”



Let the “Alarm Activity” continue until the 90s timeout is expired

Exiting from the Alarm Status and Shutting Down
Using the following AT command, the module exits “Alarm Activity” and shuts down.
AT#SHDN

3.9.5.6.

Querying the Alarm Status
When the “Alarm Time” expires, the module wakes up and starts the “Alarm Activity”
during which no “Network Activity” is performed. During “Alarm Status” (no “Network
Activity” is done), the User Application can perform some operations without
registering the module on the network. To check if the module is in the "Alarm Status"
or if the module is in the “Normal Operating” status, use the following AT command.

3.9.5.7.

Alarm Operation Example
In this example, the User is assumed to be developing a Meteorological Unit using a
battery powered module. The Meteorological Unit requirement is to measure the
weather conditions every hour and send an SMS message to the main server, indicating
the weather status just measured. The User Application should minimize the power
consumption, because the Meteorological Unit will be installed in a remote location and
its battery must last as long as possible. To minimize the power consumption, the User
Application should shut the module down as well the equipment that do not need to be
powered up all the time. The module and the equipments will be woken up every hour
for just the time needed to measure and send the required SMS message.
1. Set up the current time.
AT+CCLK="02/11/07,12:24:30+01"
OK
2. Set up the next alarm in order to program the GPIO6 pin to power up the equipment
that do not need to be powered up all the time.
AT+CALA="02/11/07,13:24:30+01",0,6,"TIME TO MEASURE & SMS…!"
OK
3. Shut down the module and the equipment.
AT#SHDN
OK
The module and the selected equipment are powered off.
4. After an hour, when the programmed alarm time is over, the module turns itself ON
in "Alarm Mode", forces high the GPIO6 pin, which turns on the power supply of the
equipment and issues every three seconds the unsolicited code:
+CALA: TIME TO MEASURE & SMS…!
5. Stop the Alarm activity in the module (recognized by the +CALA unsolicited code)
and force the module in operating mode:

GPRS Operations
A short GPRS description is reported on the following sub-paragraph. For more
information about GPRS connections and practical examples refer to [4].

4.1.

Introduction
The General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) standard permits DATA transfers in a
completely different way with respect to previous point to point communications made
with Circuit Switch Data (CSD) GSM modems.
In CSD operations the modem establishes a connection with the other party (another
modem) in such a way that all the Network devices in between are transparent to the
data exchanged, simulating a real point to point connection, just as if the other party is
directly connected with the controlling application of the modem. The other party can
be either an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or a private server, but in any case, the
arrival point must have a modem to connect to (Landline, ISDN or GSM CSD). The
connection establishment procedure defines a particular path where all the
information exchanged between the two peers flows and this path is reserved for
exclusive use of these 2 peers for all the time the connection is active.
This approach has the drawbacks of a long time to set-up the link between the two
peers (up to a minute) and a time counting bill which proceeds even if no data is
exchanged because the path resources are reserved anyway; furthermore the speed of
the data transfer is limited to 14400 bps.
An example of this kind of operation is shown in the following picture, where the point
to point connection is between the two peers as if all the devices inside the dashed line
are not present:

1vv0300784 rev.6 2010-10-04

CSD interconnectivity

In GPRS operations instead, the connection is made directly towards internet as if the
GPRS modem was a network IP socket interface. There's no data path reserved for the
data exchange between the two peers, instead the resources are allocated dynamically
on demand and the data exchanged is organized into packets typically TCP/IP,
furthermore the maximum transfer speed can be much faster than GSM CSD.
An example of GPRS connection is shown in the following picture, where the GPRS
connection is between the GPRS modem and the internet as if all the devices inside the
dashed line are not present:

GPRS interconnectivity

Telit GSM/GPRS Family Software User Guide
1vv0300784 rev.6 2010-10-04
Due to this kind of connection, when activating the GPRS connection you must provide
the network parameters to enter through the internet point of the GPRS network ISP
(Internet Service Provider) and not the phone number to be dialed; therefore it is not
possible to establish a direct point to point GPRS connection between two modems as
in CSD case, instead an internet tunneling must be done to achieve a point to point
connection between two peers.
This approach as the immediate advantage of projecting the controlling application of
the GPRS modem directly on the internet, ready to be accessed virtually from anywhere
in the world at the same cost on the GPRS; actually the billing of the GPRS connection
is based on the amount of data exchanged (number of packets transferred)
independently from the time the connection is active or where these packet must be
delivered. Therefore, it is possible to leave the controlling application always connected
and ready to receive/send data on demand, while paying only for the data really
exchanged.
The drawback of the GPRS connection is that the controlling application must have its
own TCP/IP protocol stack embedded to decode the packets that arrive from GPRS and
encode the ones to be sent through the internet.
There are few considerations than must be done on the GPRS connections:


The GPRS connection speed with a GPRS class 10 multislot device is
asymmetrical, 3 time slots in reception (43200 bps max) and 2 time slot in
sending (28800 bps max) or 4 time slots in reception (57600 bps max) and 1 time
slot in sending (14400 bps max).



The controlling application of the module must have a TCP/IP - PPP software
stack to interface with the GPRS modems.



The controlling application must relay on some ISP that may be the Network
Operator of the SIM to gain access to the internet through the GPRS connection.



Because of the point before, the receiving application must have internet access
as well.



Since the communication is based upon TCP/IP packets, it is possible to talk
simultaneously with more than one peer.



When required, the data security in internet must be guaranteed by security
protocols over the TCP/IP that must be managed by the controlling application.

The Telit Modules providing GPS features are equipped with a SiRFStar III GPS
Receiver that is controlled by means dedicated set of AT commands or dedicated NMEA
sentences, refer to [8]. The following paragraphs provide the User with a description
about the use of the NMEA sentences and the AT commands.

5.2.

GPS Serial Ports
The figures below (fig. 6 and fig. 7) show the two GPS Serial port configurations
supported by Telit Modules. GPS Serial Ports types are the following:
 SIRF BINARY: This port runs GPS navigation data in SIRF BINARY format. This
protocol is not object of the present document.
The factory configuration is 57600 bps, 8, n, 1, where it is applicable.
 NMEA: This port runs GPS navigation data in NMEA 0183 format.
The factory configuration is 4800 bps, 8, n, 1
For detailed information about setting of the physical GPS Serial Ports types provided
by the Telit Modules refer to [3]. Refer to [6] for “external module jumper setting
example”.

5.3.

WGS 84
GPS receivers perform initial position and velocity calculations using an earth-centered
earth-fixed (ECEF) coordinate system. Results may be converted to an earth model
(geoid) defined by the selected datum, as e.g. refer to [10].
For Telit Modules the default datum is WGS 84 (World Geodetic System 1984) which
provides a worldwide common grid system that may be translated into local coordinate
systems or map datums. (Local map datums are a best fit to the local shape of the
earth and not valid worldwide).

5.4.

NMEA 0183 Protocol
The NMEA 0183 is the specification created by the NMEA that defines the interface
between marine electronic equipments. The standard permits marine electronics to
send information to computers and to other marine equipments. GPS receiver interface
is defined within this specification. The actually supported version is 2.2.
NMEA 0183 Protocol enables the Telit module User to communicate with the GPS
Receiver using the NMEA Serial Port.

5.4.1.

NMEA Output Messages
As factory configured, the GPS provides the User with the following sentences
continuously sent on NMEA Serial Port: GGA, GSA, GSV, RMC. In order to enable the
VTG and GLL sentences as well, the User can use the NMEA command $PSRF103, refer
to § 5.4.2.1.2.

GGA

Time, position and fix type data.

GLL

Latitude, longitude, UTC time of position fix and status.

GSA

GPS receiver operating mode, satellites used in the position
solution and DOP values.

GSV

The number of GPS satellites in view satellite ID numbers,
elevation, azimuth, and SNR values.

VTG

Course and speed information relative to the ground.

RMC

Time, date, position, course and speed data.

*CKSUM
CKSUM is a two-hex character checksum as defined in the NMEA specification [8].
Checksum consists of a binary exclusive OR the lower 7 bits of each character after the
“$” and before the “*” symbols. The resulting 7-bit binary number is displayed as the
ASCII equivalent of two hexadecimal characters representing the contents of the
checksum. Use of checksums is required on all input messages.
<CR> <LF>
Each message is terminated using Carriage Return (CR) Line Feed (LF) which is \r\n
which is hex 0D 0A. Because \r\n are not printable ASCII characters, they are omitted
from the example strings, but must be sent to terminate the message and cause the
receiver to process that input message.

NOTE:
All fields in the SIRF proprietary NMEA messages are required, none are optional. All
NMEA messages are comma delimited.

Service and Firmware Update
The Telit Modules firmware is updated through the Serial Interface normally used for
the AT Commands.
It is suggested to provide an RS232 interface on the User Printed Circuit Board ( where
the Telit Module is soldered ) to perform the physical connection between the Telit
module and a Windows-based PC. That simple circuitry makes the firmware updating
easy when a new firmware version is released.
During the User Application development or evaluation phase of the Telit module, the
RS232 interface or the USB port implemented on the Telit Evaluation Kit (EVK2) [6]
can be used to connect the Telit module to a Windows-based PC on which a dedicated
tool for firmware updating is running.
Telit provides the User with two tools to update the firmware of the module. The
following paragraphs describe them.

NOTE:
GT terminals are complete encased modems. They do not need the Telit Evaluation Kit
(EVK2) to perform testing, evaluation and also Firmware Update. The standard RS232
port is used to perform firmware update.

6.1.

Xfp Tool
The firmware update of the module can be performed with the Xfp Tool provided by
Telit. It runs on Windows based PCs. It erases the flash memory content, and then it
downloads the new firmware on the flash memory.

Step-by-Step Upgrade Procedure
To update the Telit Module firmware follow the procedure:
1. collect information about the Telit Module and Software version using the
following AT commands:


AT+CGMR<cr>, returns the Software version information;



AT+CGMM<cr>, returns the Telit Module identification.

2. Switch OFF the Telit Module.
3. Run the Xfp.exe tool, the following windows are displayed. Select COM port,
12
speed and stream file (stream file holds new firmware). For UC and CC products
use the Telit Auxiliary Port, refer to document [15].

12

To use speed grater than 115200 Bps a dedicated hardware on PC is needed.
