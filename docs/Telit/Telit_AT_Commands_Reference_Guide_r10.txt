Overview

2.1.

About the document
This document is to describe all AT commands implemented on the Telit wireless
modules listed on the Applicabilty Table.

NOTE:
Telit suggests all the system developers to use always the newer AT Commands
Interface Style defined by AT#SELINT=2; and in case you are starting a new design we
highly recommend you to use the newer AT Commands Interface Style defined by
AT#SELINT=2 which gives you a possibility to include all Telit’s new features and also
all future implementations.
Moreover, Telit suggests to use the following settings to get the performance most
customers are looking for:
AT#SMSMODE=1
AT#REGMODE=1

AT COMMANDS
The Telit wireless module family can be controlled via the serial interface using the
1
standard AT commands . The Telit wireless module family is compliant with:
1. Hayes standard AT command set, in order to maintain the compatibility with
existing SW programs.
2. 3GPP TS 27.007 specific AT command and GPRS specific commands.
3. 3GPP TS 27.005 specific AT commands for SMS (Short Message Service) and
CBS (Cell Broadcast Service)
4. FAX Class 1 compatible commands
Moreover Telit wireless module family supports also Telit proprietary AT commands for
special purposes.
The following is a description of how to use the AT commands with the Telit wireless
module family.

3.1.

Definitions
The following syntactical definitions apply:
<CR> Carriage return character, is the command line and result code terminator
character, which value, in decimal ASCII between 0 and 255,is specified within
parameter S3. The default value is 13.
<LF> Linefeed character, is the character recognised as line feed character. Its
value, in decimal ASCII between 0 and 255, is specified within parameter S4.
The default value is 10. The line feed character is output after carriage return
character if verbose result codes are used (V1 option used ) otherwise, if
numeric format result codes are used (V0 option used) it will not appear in the
result codes.
<...>

Name enclosed in angle brackets is a syntactical element. They do not appear in
the command line.

[...]

Optional subparameter of a command or an optional part of TA information
response is enclosed in square brackets. Brackets themselves do not appear in
the command line. When subparameter is not given in AT commands which

1

The AT is an ATTENTION command and is used as a prefix to other parameters in a string. The AT command
combined with other parameters can be set up in the communications package or typed in manually as a
command line instruction.combined with other parameters can be set up in the communications package or
typed in manually as a command line instruction.

have a Read command, new value equals to its previous value. In AT commands
which do not store the values of any of their subparameters, and so have not a
Read command, which are called action type commands, action should be done
on the basis of the recommended default setting of the subparameter.

3.2.

AT Command Syntax
The syntax rules followed by Telit implementation of either Hayes AT commands, GSM
commands and FAX commands are very similar to those of standard basic and
extended AT commands. A special command (#SELINT, see §3.5.2.1.1) has been
introduced in order to have an AT interface very close to the standard one.
There are two types of extended command:
-

Parameter type commands. This type of commands may be “set” (to store a
value or values for later use), “read” (to determine the current value or values
stored), or “tested” (to determine ranges of values supported). Each of them has
a test command (trailing =?) to give information about the type of its
subparameters; they also have a Read command (trailing ?) to check the
current values of subparameters.

-

Action type commands. This type of command may be “executed” or “tested”.



“executed“ to invoke a particular function of the equipment, which generally
involves more than the simple storage of a value for later use



“tested” to determine:

(if the command #SELINT=0 or #SELINT=1 has been issued, see §3.5.2.1.1)
if subparameters are associated with the action, the ranges of subparameters
values that are supported; if the command has no subparameters, issuing the
correspondent Test command (trailing =?) raises the result code “ERROR”.
Note: issuing the Read command (trailing ?) causes the command to be executed.

(if the command #SELINT=2 has been issued, see §3.5.2.1.1)
whether or not the equipment implements the Action Command (in this case
issuing the correspondent Test command - trailing =? - returns the OK result code),
and, if subparameters are associated with the action, the ranges of subparameters
values that are supported.
Action commands don’t store the values of any of their possible subparameters.

80000ST10025a Rev. 10 – 2011-02-17

Moreover:
 (for #SELINT=0 or #SELINT=1 only)
An enhanced test command (trailing =??) has been introduced to maintain
backward
compatibility for those commands whose subparameters changed
the range of possible
values from version to version.


(for #SELINT=2 only)
The response to the Test Command (trailing =?) may be changed in the
future by Telit to
allow the description of new values/functionalities



(for #SELINT=2 only)
If all the subparameters of a parameter type command +CMD (or #CMD or
$CMD) are
optional, issuing AT+CMD=<CR> (or AT#CMD=<CR> or
AT$CMD=<CR>) causes the OK result code to be returned and the previous
values of the omitted subparameters to be
retained.

3.2.1.

String Type Parameters
A string, either enclosed between quotes or not, is considered to be a valid string type
parameter input. According to V25.ter space characters are ignored on the command
line and may be used freely for formatting purposes, unless they are embedded in
numeric or quoted string constants; therefore a string containing a space character
has to be enclosed between quotes to be considered a valid string type parameter (e.g.
typing AT+COPS=1,0,”A1” is the same as typing AT+COPS=1,0,A1; typing
AT+COPS=1,0,”A BB” is different from typing AT+COPS=1,0,A BB).
When #SELINT=0 (or 1) mode is selected, a string not enclosed between quotes is
changed in upper case (e.g. mickey become MICKEY), while a string enclosed between
quotes is case sensitive.
When #SELINT=2 mode is selected, a string is always case sensitive.
A small set of commands requires always to write the input string parameters within
quotes: this is explicitly reported in the specific descriptions.

3.2.2.

Command Lines
A command line is made up of three elements: the prefix, the body and the
termination character.
The command line prefix consists of the characters “AT” or “at”, or, to repeat the
execution of the previous command line, the characters “A/” or “a/” or AT#/ or at#/.

AT Commands Reference Guide
80000ST10025a Rev. 10 – 2011-02-17

The termination character may be selected by a user option (parameter S3), the
default being <CR>.
The basic structures of the command line are:
 ATCMD1<CR> where AT is the command line prefix, CMD1 is the body of a basic
command (nb: the name of the command never begins with the character “+”) and
<CR> is the command line terminator character
 ATCMD2=10<CR> where 10 is a subparameter
 AT+CMD1;+CMD2=, ,10<CR> These are two examples of extended commands (nb:
2
the name of the command always begins with the character “+” ). They are
delimited with semicolon. In the second command the subparameter is omitted.
 +CMD1?<CR> This is a Read command for checking current subparameter values
 +CMD1=?<CR> This is a test command for checking possible subparameter values
These commands might be performed in a single command line as shown below:
ATCMD1 CMD2=10+CMD1;+CMD2=, ,10;+CMD1?;+CMD1=?<CR>
anyway it is always preferable to separate into different command lines the basic
commands and the extended commands; furthermore it is suggested to avoid placing
several action commands in the same command line, because if one of them fails, then
an error message is received but it is not possible to argue which one of them has
failed the execution.
If command V1 is enabled (verbose responses codes) and all commands in a command
line has been performed successfully, result code <CR><LF>OK<CR><LF> is sent from
the TA to the TE, if subparameter values of a command are not accepted by the TA or
command itself is invalid, or command cannot be performed for some reason, result
code <CR><LF>ERROR<CR><LF> is sent and no subsequent commands in the
command line are processed.
If command V0 is enabled (numeric responses codes), and all commands in a
command line has been performed successfully, result code 0<CR> is sent from the TA
to the TE, if sub-parameter values of a command are not accepted by the TA or
command itself is invalid, or command cannot be performed for some reason, result
code 4<CR> and no subsequent commands in the command line are processed.

The set of proprietary AT commands differentiates from the standard one because the name of each of them
begins with either “@”, “#”, “$” or “*”. Proprietary AT commands follow the same syntax rules as extended
commands

In case of errors depending on ME operation, ERROR (or 4) response may be replaced
by +CME ERROR: <err> or +CMS ERROR: <err>.

NOTE:
The command line buffer accepts a maximum of 80 characters. If this number is
exceeded none of the commands will be executed and TA returns ERROR.

Information Responses And Result Codes
The TA response, in case of verbose response format enabled, for the previous
examples command line could be as shown below:


information response to +CMD1?
<CR><LF>+CMD1:2,1,10<CR><LF>



information response to +CMD1=?
<CR><LF>+CMD1(0-2),(0,1),(0-15)<CR><LF>



final result code

<CR><LF>OK<CR><LF>

Moreover there are other two types of result codes:


result codes that inform about progress of TA operation (e.g. connection
establishment CONNECT)



result codes that indicate occurrence of an event not directly associated with
issuance of a command from TE (e.g. ring indication RING).

Command Response Time-Out
Every command issued to the Telit modules returns a result response, if response
codes are enabled (default). The time needed to process the given command and return
the response varies, depending on the command type. Commands that do not interact
with the SIM or the network, and only involve internal setups or readings, have an
immediate response.Commands that interact with the SIM or the network could take
many seconds to send a response, depending on SIM configuration (e.g., number of
contacts stored in the phonebook, number of stored SMS), or on the network the
command may interact with.
In the table below are listed only the commands whose interaction with the SIM or the
network could lead to long response timings. When not otherwise specified, timing is
referred to set command.
For phonebook and SMS writing and reading related commands, timing is referred to
commands issued after phonebook sorting is completed.
For DTMF sending and dialling commands timing is referred to module registered on
network (“AT+CREG?” answer is “+CREG: 0,1” or “+CREG: 0,5”).
For Python commands, timing is referred to commands issued with module in idle,
flash memory not full and not fragmented, and after the first Python command. The
first Python command to be issued causes a system initialization that could last a
couple of minutes. Baud rate is fixed at 115200.

3.2.5.

Command Issuing Timing
The chain Command -> Response shall always be respected and a new command must
not be issued before the module has terminated all the sending of its response result
code (whatever it may be).
This applies especially to applications that “sense” the OK text and therefore may send
the next command before the complete code <CR><LF>OK<CR><LF> is sent by the
module.
It is advisable anyway to wait for at least 20ms between the end of the reception of the
response and the issue of the next AT command.
If the response codes are disabled and therefore the module does not report any
response to the command, then at least the 20ms pause time shall be respected.
During command mode, due to hardware limitations, under severe CPU load the serial
port can loose some characters if placed in autobauding at high speeds. Therefore if
you encounter this problem fix the baud rate with +IPR command.

3.3.

Storage

3.3.1.

Factory Profile And User Profiles
The Telit wireless modules stores the values set by several commands in the internal
non volatile memory (NVM), allowing to remember this setting even after power off. In
the NVM these values are set either as factory profile or as user profiles: there are
two customizable user profiles and one factory profile in the NVM of the device: by
default the device will start with user profile 0 equal to factory profile.
For backward compatibility each profile is divided into two sections, one base section
which was historically the one that was saved and restored in early releases of code,
and the extended section which includes all the remaining values.
The &W command is used to save the actual values of both sections of profiles into the
NVM user profile.
Commands &Y and &P are both used to set the profile to be loaded at startup. &Y
instructs the device to load at startup only the base section. &P instructs the device to
load at startup the full profile: base + extended sections.
The &F command resets to factory profile values only the command of the base section
of profile, while the &F1 resets to factory profile values the full set of base + extended
section commands.
The values set by other commands are stored in NVM outside the profile: some of them
are stored always, without issuing any &W, some other are stored issuing specific

The values set by following commands are automatically stored in NVM, without issuing
any storing command and independently from the profile (unique values), and are
automatically restored at startup:
#SELINT

#REGMODE
#DIALMODE
#ENS
#ENHSIM
#TTY
#NWSCANTMR
#TCPMAXDAT

The values set by following commands are stored in NVM on demand, issuing specific
commands and independently from the profile:
+CSCA

+CSMP

+CSCB

stored by +CSAS 9 command and restored by +CRES9 command
7

+CSCB is still stored in the profile extended section only for backward compatibility issues: its actual storing
and restoring are accomplished issuing +CSAS and +CRES
8
It is partially stored in NVM; see command description.

Command Line General Format

3.5.1.1.

Command Line Prefixes

3.5.1.1.1.

Starting A Command Line - AT

AT - Starting A Command Line
SELINT 0 / 1 / 2
AT
The prefix AT, or at, is a two-character abbreviation (ATtention), always
used to start a command line to be sent from TE to TA, with the only
exception of AT#/ prefix
Reference
3GPP TS 27.007

3.5.1.1.2.

Last Command Automatic Repetition - A/

A/ - Last Command Automatic Repetition
SELINT 0 / 1 / 2
A/
If the prefix A/ or a/ is issued, the MODULE immediately execute once again
the body of the preceding command line. No editing is possible and no
termination character is necessary. A command line may be repeated
multiple times through this mechanism, if desired.
If A/ is issued before any command line has been executed, the preceding
command line is assumed to have been empty (that results in an OK result
code).
23

Available for the GPS producs with the following Order-Num.: 3990250689 and 3990250690

SELINT 0 / 1 / 2

Note: this command works only at fixed IPR.

Reference

3.5.1.1.3.

Note: the custom prefix AT#/ has been defined: it causes the last
command to be executed again too; but it doesn’t need a fixed IPR.

Repeat Last Command - AT#/

AT#/ - Repeat Last Command
SELINT 0 / 1 / 2
AT#/
The prefix is used to execute again the last received command.

AT Interface Backward Compatibility
There are some slight modifications amongst the AT interfaces of Telit products. In
order to keep backward compatibility and on the same time to give the opportunity to
the customer to get competitor compatibility, Telit modules offer the specific command
#SELINT to switch the behaviour of the device and its AT command interface. It is up to
the user to select the AT interface he prefers.
The following table shows which AT commands interface can be applied and is default
for the specific product:

S Parameters
Basic commands that begin with the letter “S” are known as “S-Parameters”. The
number following the “S” indicates the “parameter number” being referenced. If the
number is not recognized as a valid parameter number, an ERROR result code is
issued.
If no value is given for the subparameter of an S-Parameter, an ERROR result code
will be issued and the stored value left unchanged.

Note: what follows is a special way to select and set an S-parameter:
1. ATSn<CR> selects n as current parameter number. If the value of n is in the range (0, 2,
3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 12, 25, 30, 38), this command establishes Sn as last selected parameter.
Every value out of this range and less than 256 can be used but has no meaning and is
maintained only for backward compatibility with landline modems.
2. AT=<value><CR> or ATS=<value><CR> set the contents of the selected S-parameter
Example:
ATS7<CR>
AT=40<CR>
ATS=15<CR>
3. AT?

establishes S7 as last selected parameter.
sets the content of S7 to 40

There are situations in which the presentation of the URC controlled by
+CREG is slightly different from ETSI specifications: e.g. it is possible to
have an excessive presentation of the URC +CREG: 4. We identified this
behaviour and decided to maintain it as default for backward compatibility
issues. It is indeed possible to avoid it simply issuing AT#REGMODE=1 (see
#REGMODE): this puts the Operation Mode of Registration Status
Commands in ‘Enhanced Registration Operation Mode’ which is more

Note: issuing AT+CFUN=4 actually causes the module to perform either a
network deregistration and a SIM deactivation.
Note: if power saving enabled, it reduces the power consumption during the
idle time, thus allowing a longer standby time with a given battery capacity.
Note: to place the module in power saving mode, set the <fun> parameter
at value = 5 and the line DTR (RS232) must be set to OFF. Once in power
saving, the CTS line switch to the OFF status to signal that the module is
really in power saving condition.
During the power saving condition, before sending any AT command on the
serial line, the DTR must be set to ON (0V) to exit from power saving and
must be waited for the CTS (RS232) line to go in ON status.
Until the DTR line is ON, the module will not return back in the power
saving condition.

AT+CFUN?
AT+CFUN=?

Note: the power saving function does not affect the network behavior of the
MODULE, even during the power save condition the module remains
registered on the network and reachable for incoming calls or SMS. If a call
arrives during the power save, then the module will wake up and proceed
normally with the unsolicited incoming call code

SELINT 2
AT+CFUN=
Set command selects the level of functionality in the ME.
[<fun>[,<rst>]]
Parameters:
<fun> - is the power saving function mode
0 - minimum functionality, NON-CYCLIC SLEEP mode: in this mode, the AT
interface is not accessible. Consequently, once you have set <fun> level
0, do not send further characters. Otherwise these characters remain in
the input buffer and may delay the output of an unsolicited result code.
The first wake-up event, or rising RTS line, stops power saving and takes
the ME back to full functionality level <fun>=1.
1 - mobile full functionality with power saving disabled (factory default)
2 - disable TX
4 - disable both TX and RX
5 - mobile full functionality with power saving enabled
7 - CYCLIC SLEEP mode: in this mode, the serial interface is periodically
enabled while CTS is active. If characters are recognized on the serial
interface, the ME stays active for 2 seconds after the last character was
sent or received. ME exits SLEEP mode only, if AT+CFUN=1 is entered
9 – just as 0 but with different wake-up events (see SW User Guide)
<rst> - reset flag
0 - do not reset the ME before setting it to <fun> functionality level
1 – reset the device. The device is fully functional after the reset. This value
is available only for <fun> = 1 and for 10.00.xxx release
Note: issuing AT+CFUN=4[,0] actually causes the module to perform either
a network deregistration and a SIM deactivation.
Note: if power saving enabled, it reduces the power consumption during the
idle time, thus allowing a longer standby time with a given battery capacity.
Note: to place the module in power saving mode, set the <fun> parameter

SELINT 0 / 1
Set command sends to the device a password which is necessary before it
can be operated (SIM PIN, SIM PUK, PH-SIM PIN, etc.).
If the PIN required is SIM PUK or SIM PUK2, the <newpin> is required.
This second pin, <newpin>, will replace the old pin in the SIM.
The command may be used to change the SIM PIN by sending it with both
parameters <pin> and <newpin> when PIN request is pending; if no PIN
request is pending the command will return an error code and to change
the PIN the command +CPWD must be used instead.
Parameters:
<pin> - string type value
<newpin> - string type value.
To check the status of the PIN request use the command AT+CPIN?

Although it is possible to issue the command when SIM PIN is pending, it
will answer ERROR if “message” or “smsfull” indicators are enabled in

first.

If the device is in "alarm mode" and it does not receive the #WAKE

4 - the MODULE wakes up in "alarm mode" if at the alarm time it was off,

the pin GPIO6 high, provided its <direction> has been set to alarm

Set command stores in the internal Real Time Clock an alarm time with
<time>[,<n>[,<type> respective settings. It is possible to set up a recurrent alarm for one or
[,<text>[,<recurr>
more days in the week.
[,<silent>]]]]]
Currently just one alarm can be set.
When the RTC time reaches the alarm time then the alarm starts, the
behaviour of the MODULE depends upon the setting <type> and if the device
was already ON at the moment when the alarm time had come.
Parameters:
<time> - current alarm time as quoted string
“” - (empty string) deletes the current alarm and resets all the +CALA
parameters to the “factory default” configuration
"hh:mm:ss±zz" - format to be used only when issuing +CALA with
parameter <recurr> too.
"yy/MM/dd,hh:mm:ss±zz" - generic format: it’s the same as defined for
+CCLK (see)
<n> - index of the alarm
0 - The only value supported is 0.
<type> - alarm behaviour type
0 - reserved for other equipment use.
1 - the MODULE simply wakes up fully operative as if the ON/OFF button
had been pressed. If the device is already ON at the alarm time, then it
does nothing (default).
2 - the MODULE wakes up in "alarm mode" if at the alarm time it was off,
otherwise it remains fully operative. In both cases the MODULE issues
an unsolicited code every 3s:
+CALA: <text>
where <text> is the +CALA optional parameter previously set.
The device keeps on sending the unsolicited code every 3s until a
#WAKE or #SHDN command is received or a 90 seconds timer expires.
If the device is in "alarm mode" and it does not receive the #WAKE
command within 90s then it shuts down.

3 - the MODULE wakes up in "alarm mode" if at the alarm time it was off,
otherwise it remains fully operative. In both cases the MODULE starts
playing the alarm tone on the selected path for the ringer (see command
#SRP)
The device keeps on playing the alarm tone until a #WAKE or #SHDN
command is received or a 90 s time-out occurs. If the device is in "alarm
mode" and it does not receive the #WAKE command within 90s then it
shuts down.
4 - the MODULE wakes up in "alarm mode" if at the alarm time it was off,
otherwise it remains fully operative. In both cases the MODULE brings
the pin GPIO6 high, provided its <direction> has been set to alarm
output, and keeps it in this state until a #WAKE or #SHDN command is
received or a 90 seconds timer expires. If the device is in "alarm mode"
and it does not receive the #WAKE command within 90s then it shuts
down.
5 - the MODULE will make both the actions as for type=2 and <type>=3.
6 - the MODULE will make both the actions as for type=2 and <type>=4.
7 - the MODULE will make both the actions as for type=3 and <type>=4.
8 - the MODULE wakes up in "alarm mode" if at the alarm time it was off,
otherwise it remains fully operative. In both cases the MODULE sets
High the RI output pin. The RI output pin remains High until next
#WAKE issue or until a 90s timer expires. If the device is in "alarm
mode" and it does not receive the #WAKE command within 90s. After
that it shuts down.
<text> - unsolicited alarm code text string. It has meaning only if <type> is
equal to 2 or 5 or 6.
<recurr> - string type value indicating day of week for the alarm in one of
the following formats:
“<1..7>[,<1..7>[, … ]]” - it sets a recurrent alarm for one or more days in the
week; the digits 1 to 7 corresponds to the days in the week (Monday is
1).
“0” - it sets a recurrent alarm for all days in the week.
<silent> - integer type indicating if the alarm is silent or not.
0 - the alarm will not be silent;
1 - the alarm will be silent.
During the "alarm mode" the device will not make any network scan and
will not register to any network and therefore is not able to dial or receive
any call or SMS, the only commands that can be issued to the MODULE in
this state are the #WAKE and #SHDN, every other command must not be
issued during this state.

<value> - actual temperature expressed in Celsius degrees.

Setting of the following optional parameters has meaning only if
<mod>=0
<urcmode> - URC presentation mode.
0 - it disables the presentation of the temperature monitor URC
1 - it enables the presentation of the temperature monitor URC, whenever
the module internal temperature reaches either operating or extreme
levels; the unsolicited message is in the format:
#TEMPMEAS: <level>,<value>
where:
<level> and <value> are as before
<action> - sum of integers, each representing an action to be done
whenever the module internal temperature reaches either
operating or extreme levels (default is 0). If <action> is not zero, it
is mandatory to set the <hyst_time> parameter too.
0..7 - as a sum of:
0 - no action
1 - automatic shut-down when the temperature is beyond the
extreme bounds
2 - RF TX circuits automatically disabled (using +CFUN=2) when
operating temperature bounds are reached. When the
temperature is back to normal the module is brought back to the
previous state, before RF TX disabled.
4 - the output pin <GPIO> is tied HIGH when operating temperature
bounds are reached; when the temperature is back to normal the
output pin <GPIO> is tied LOW. If this <action> is required, it is
mandatory to set the <GPIO> parameter too.
<hyst_time> - hysteresis time: all the actions happen only if the extreme
or operating bounds are maintained at least for this period.
This parameter is needed and required if <action> is not zero.
0..255 - time in seconds
<GPIO> - GPIO number. valid range is “any output pin” (see “Hardware
User’s Guide”). This parameter is needed and required only if
<action>=4 is required.

high during SMS transmission and receiving. Even if the TXMON in this
case is set as GPIO in output, the read command AT#GPIO=5,2 returns
#GPIO:2,0, as the GPIO is in alternate mode.
1 - TXMON is set in alternate mode and the Timer unit controls its state.
TXMON goes high 200s before TXEN goes high. Then power ramps
start raising and there is the burst transmission. Finally TXMON drops
down 47s after power ramps stop falling down. This behaviour is
repeated for every transmission burst.
Note: if user sets GPIO 5 as input or output the TXMON does not follow the
above behaviour.

The range of available positions in a phonebook depends on the selected
phonebook. This is the reason why the test command returns three ranges
of values: the first for parameter <mode>, the second for parameter
<index> when “ME” is the chosen phonebook, the third for parameter
<index> when “SM” is the chosen phonebook.
Issuing #ACALEXT causes the #ACAL <mode> to be changed.

When a packet comes from the IP address incoming_IP, the
firewall chain rules will be scanned for matching with the following
criteria:
incoming_IP & <net_mask> = <ip_addr> & <net_mask>
If criteria is matched, then the packet is accepted and the rule scan
is finished; if criteria is not matched for any chain the packet is
silently dropped.

#SGACT - Context Activation
SELINT 2
AT#SGACT=<cid>,
Execution command is used to activate or deactivate either the GSM context
<stat>[,<userId>,
or the specified PDP context.
<pwd>]
Parameters:
<cid> - PDP context identifier
0 - specifies the GSM context
1..5 - numeric parameter which specifies a particular PDP context
definition
<stat>
0 - deactivate the context
1 - activate the context
<userId> - string type, used only if the context requires it
<pwd> - string type, used only if the context requires it
Note: context activation/deactivation returns ERROR if there is not any
socket associated to it (see AT#SCFG).
Note: after the GSM context has been activated, you can use either
Multisocket, or FTP or Email AT commands to send/receive TCP/IP packets
via GSM.
Note: to deactivate the GSM context, AT#SGACT=0,0 has to be issued on the
same serial port used when the context was activated.
Note: GSM context activation is affected by AT+CBST command. In
particular, GSM context activation is just allowed with “non transparent”
data calls.
Note: activating a GSM context while a PDP context is already activated
causes the PDP context to be suspended.

AT#SGACT?

Note: if GSM context is active, it is not allowed any PDP context activation.
Returns the state of all the contexts that have been defined through the

(In this last case obviously it is necessary to set AT#SKIPESC=1).
Note: to use #BASE64 in command mode, if data to send exceed
maximum value for #SSENDEXT command, they have to be divided
in multiple parts.
These parts have to be a multiple of 57 bytes, except for the last
one, to distinguish EOF condition.
(Base64 encoding rules)
For the same reason if #SRECV command is used by the
application to receive data, a multiple of 78 bytes has to be
considered.
Note: to use #SRECV to receive data with <dec> enabled, it is
necessary to consider that:
reading <maxByte> bytes from socket, user will get less due
to decoding that is performed.

DNS Response Caching - #CACHEDNS

#CACHEDNS – DNS Response Caching
SELINT 2
AT#CACHEDNS=
Set command enables caching a mapping of domain names to IP addresses,
[<mode>]
as does a resolver library.
Parameter:
<mode>
0 - caching disabled; it cleans the cache too
1 - caching enabled
Note: the validity period of each cached entry (i.e. how long a DNS response
remains valid) is determined by a value called the Time To Live (TTL), set
by the administrator of the DNS server handing out the response.
Note: If the cache is full (8 elements) and a new IP address is resolved, an
element is deleted from the cache: the one that has not been used for the
longest time.

AT#SKTD?

AT#SKTD=?
Example

Note: this command is not allowed for sockets associated to a GSM context
(see #SCFG).
Read command reports the socket dial parameters values, in the format:
AT#SKTD: <socket type>,<remote port>,<remote addr>,
<closure type>,<local port>
Test command returns the allowed values for the parameters.

AT#SKTD=1,1024,"123.255.020.001", ,1025
CONNECT

In this way my local port 1025 is opened to the remote port 1024
AT#SKTD=0,1024,"www.telit.net", 255
CONNECT

Note

The main difference between this command and #SKTOP is that this
command does not interact with the GPRS context status, leaving it ON or
OFF according to the #GPRS setting, therefore when the connection made
with #SKTD is closed the context (and hence the local IP address) is
maintained.

SELINT 2

The hexadecimal number is actually a bit mask, where each bit, when
set, indicates that the corresponding event has to be monitored (e.g., if
<event list mask> is 0x0001, it means that MT call has to be monitored).

In these cases neither #STGI nor #STSR commands are
required:
 AT#STGI is accepted anyway.
 AT#STSR=<cmdType>,0 will answer OK but do nothing.
All other commands:
the unsolicited indication will report just the proactive command type:
#STN: <cmdType>

Note: if the call control or SMS control facility in the SIM is activated,
when the customer application makes an outgoing call, or sends an SS or
USSD, or an SMS, the following #STN unsolicited indication could be sent,
according to GSM 11.14, to indicate whether the outgoing call has been
accepted, rejected or modified by the SIM, or if the SMS service centre
address or destination has been changed:
#STN: <cmdTerminateValue>,<Result>[,<TextInfo>[,<Number>
[,<MODestAddr>]]]
where
<cmdTerminateValue>
150 - SMS control response
160 - call/SS/USSD response
<Result>
0 - Call/SMS not allowed

#STIA - SIM Toolkit Interface Activation

SELINT 2

Note: an unsolicited result code
#STN: 254
is sent if the user has indicated the need to end the proactive SIM
application session (AT#STSR=<cmdType>,16 i.e. “proactive SIM
application session terminated by the user” according to GSM 11.14).
The TA does not need to respond directly, i.e. AT#STSR is not required.
It is possible to restart the SAT session from the main menu again with the
command AT#STGI=37.
Note: The settings are saved on user profile and available on following
reboot. SIM Toolkit activation/deactivation is only performed at power on.
Note: from version 10.0x.xx4 the set command returns ERROR when USIM
is enabled (AT#ENAUSIM? returns 1).
AT#STIA?

Read command can be used to get information about the SAT interface in
the format:
#STIA: <state>,<mode>,<timeout>,<SatProfile>
where:
<state> - the device is in one of the following state:
0 - SIM has not started its application yet
1 - SIM has started its application (SAT main menu ready)
<mode> - SAT and unsolicited indications enabling status (see above)
<timeout> - time-out for user responses (see above)
<SatProfile> - SAT Terminal Profile according to GSM 11.14, i. e. the list of
SIM Application Toolkit facilities that are supported by the ME.
The profile cannot be changed by the TA.
Note: In SAT applications usually an SMS message is sent to the network
provider containing service requests, e.g. to send the latest news. The
provider returns a message with the requested information.
Before activating SAT it is recommended to set the SMS text mode with
command AT+CMGF=1 and to enable unsolicited indications for incoming
SMS messages with command +CNMI.

SELINT 2
1 - help information available
<numOfItems> - number of items in the list
<titleText> - string giving menu title
<itemId> - item identifier
1..<numOfItems>
<itemText> - title of item
<nextActionId> - the next proactive command type to be issued upon
execution of the menu item.
0 - no next action information available.

Note: upon receiving the #STGI response, the TA must send #STSR
command (see below) to confirm the execution of the proactive command
and provide any required user response, e.g. selected menu item.
AT#STGI?

The read command can be used to request the currently ongoing proactive
command and the SAT state in the format
#STGI: <state>,cmdType>
where:
<state> - SAT interface state (see #STIA)
<cmdType> - ongoing proactive command

AT#STGI=?
Note

An error message will be returned if there is no pending command.
Test command returns the range for the parameters <state> and
<cmdType>.
The unsolicited notification sent to the user:
#STN: 37
is an indication that the main menu of the SIM Application has been sent to
the TA. It will be stored by the TA so that it can be displayed later at any time
by issuing an AT#STGI=37 command.
A typical SAT session on AT interface starts after an #STN: 37 unsolicited
code is received, if enabled. At that point usually an AT#STGI=37 command
is issued, and after the SAT main menu has been displayed on TE an
AT#STSR=37,0,x command is issued to select an item in the menu (see
below). The session usually ends with a SIM action like sending an SMS, or
starting a call. After this, to restart the session from the beginning going
back to SAT main menu it is usually required an AT#STSR=37,16 command.
The unsolicited notification sent to the user:
